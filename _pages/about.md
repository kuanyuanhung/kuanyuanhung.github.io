My name is Yuan-Hung Kuan (官苑閎). I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Applied Mathematics Lab (System Science and Mathematics program) at Washington University in St. Louis, advised by Prof. Jr-Shin Li. My research interests include control theory and dynamical systems, optimization, learning and numerical methods in data science.

I received my bachelor's degrees (major in systems engineering and minor in mathematics) from National Taiwan University in 2019 and I was a visiting summer intern at WashU in 2019.
